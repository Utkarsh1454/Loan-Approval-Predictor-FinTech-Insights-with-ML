# Loan Approval Predictor: FinTech Insights with ML

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved** or **rejected** based on applicant and loan-related features.
It is designed to demonstrate **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and **machine learning modeling** for real-world **FinTech** applications.

## 🎯 Goal

Use machine learning to classify loan applications into:

* Approved ✅
* Not Approved ❌

## 🧾 Features in Dataset

* **Applicant Income**
* **Loan Amount**
* **Credit Score**
* **Education Level**
* **Self-Employed** (Yes/No)

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle missing values
   * Encode categorical variables
   * Remove duplicates (if any)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Summary statistics
   * Distribution plots
   * Correlation heatmap
   * Target variable balance check

3. **Modeling**

   * **Logistic Regression**
   * **Decision Tree Classifier**

4. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * Accuracy
   * Precision, Recall, F1-score
   * Confusion Matrix

5. **Model Comparison & Conclusion**

   * Identify the better performing model
   * Explain possible reasons for performance difference

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* scikit-learn

## 📊 Results

* Logistic Regression: X% accuracy
* Decision Tree: Y% accuracy
  *(Detailed comparison inside the final report)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place the file `loan_approval_.xlsx` in the project directory.
2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

📈 Real-Life Applications
